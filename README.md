### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ It's the BlimpCat!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on coding and actually understanding what I am typing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a bigger nerd.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with how to have a social life.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Kingdom Hearts lore when you can't sleep, you will fall asleep soon.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned how to sew because I couldn't find a stuffed animal of a turtle duck from ATLA, so I made my own.
